# Project Name
Eat Da Burger!

## Description
This is a Node.js based app that uses Express, Handlebars, and MySQL to track and store user input text in a database. A user can submit any string that will be stored in a database. It has a "Devoured" state that is tracked and changed when the appropriate button is clicked.

## Motivation
This project was intended to integrate the Express.js framework with Handlebars and a MySQL database for the developer's own experience.

## Results
The project was overall successful for the scope intended.

## Individual Responsibilities.
This project was written entirely by Tom Elliott.

### Challenges
Deploying correctly to Heroku and linking the database through the JawsDB add-on proved a little tricky, but still surmountable.

## Improvements
In the future, this app can be modified the allow editing of an input after it has been submitted. Also, attachable pictures could be implemented.
